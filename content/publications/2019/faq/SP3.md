Overall, in this study, we successfully built a site genome editing in allotetraploid cotton with 87% editing efficiency and no off‐target effects using CRISPR/Cpf1 system. Our results are comparable with the editing efficiency in rice and maize (Lee et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018). More importantly, the phenotypic and the genetic edition occurred in the T0 generation were inherited faithfully to their progenies and some homozygous mutants were obtained in the T1 generation. In the future, whole‐genome sequencing (WGS) will be applied to evaluate the off‐target of CRISPR/Cpf1 system in cotton. These results support the finding that the CRISPR/Cpf1 system is a highly specific and efficient system in plant genome editing, which will be a very promising alternative of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in cotton.
