Black pepper (*Piper nigrum*), dubbed the ‘King of Spices’ and ‘Black Gold’, is one of the most
widely used spices. Here, we present its reference genome assembly by integrating PacBio,
10x Chromium, BioNano DLS optical mapping, and Hi-C mapping technologies. The 761.2 Mb
sequences (45 scaffolds with an N50 of 29.8 Mb) are assembled into 26 pseudochromosomes.
A phylogenomic analysis of representative plant genomes places magnoliids as sister
to the monocots-eudicots clade and indicates that black pepper has diverged from the shared
Laurales-Magnoliales lineage approximately 180 million years ago. Comparative genomic
analyses reveal specific gene expansions in the glycosyltransferase, cytochrome P450, shikimate
hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, lysine decarboxylase, and acyltransferase gene
families. Comparative transcriptomic analyses disclose berry-specific upregulated expression
in representative genes in each of these gene families. These data provide an evolutionary
perspective and shed light on the metabolic processes relevant to the molecular basis of
species-specific piperine biosynthesis.
